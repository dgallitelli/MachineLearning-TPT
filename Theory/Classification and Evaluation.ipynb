    "\n",
    "The perceptron is the very basic component of any artificial neural network. It is modeled after the behavior of the neurons in the brain, having a number of input channels, a processing core and an output channel. Three phases can be identified for how the processing work in a neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **weights** - a certain value in input, namely an attribute, is multiplied by a *weight* value that is assigned to the particular input; during the **learning phase**, the perceptron can adjust the weights based on the error of the last test result.\n",
    "2. **sum** - the weighted signals are summed up to a single value, applying an offset called *bias* which is also updated during the learning phase.\n",
    "3. **activation** - the result of the neuron's calculation is turned into an output signal by feeding it to a *activation function* (also called *transfer function*). Different functions can be used here, such as the *sign* function, the *step* function, or the *sigmoid* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input *[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]*, where *x<sub>i</sub>* data vector and *y<sub>i</sub>* the label of the data, our goal is to minimize the error between output of the neuron (prediction) and the training label set. Generally, we want to minimize the **mean-square error** in order to increase our accuracy. This can be done by updating the set of weights, using **backward propagation of the error** from which we can compute the **weight update rule**:\n",

    "Neural networks are really powerful. They are easy to use and don't require any parameters definition. But, it is a *black-box* learning model, meaning that no easy interpretation between input and output can be understood from the model itself. Moreover, reaching convergence to a good result, especially with feature-rich data and many layers, can be quite both time and resource intensive. \n",

    "\n",
    "A decision tree model is really easy to understand and interpret. It handles pretty well both numerical and categorical data, unlike other models (e.g. neural networks). Decision trees also requires very little data preparation: trees can handle qualitative predictors, therefore not needing data normalization. It performs extremely well with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are generally very non-robust, meaning that a slight change in data can bring a big change in the tree and consequently in the final prediction. Decision tree learners can incur into **overfitting**: the model created may be too specific for the problem at hand and not generalizable."
